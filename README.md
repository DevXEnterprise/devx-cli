# Create devx

The simplest method to kick off an Express.js project with TypeScript is to use `npx create-devx`. This command-line tool allows you to swiftly begin developing a new Express.js application, with all the necessary setup already configured for you.

### Interactive

You can create a new project interactively by running:

```bash
npx create-devx@latest
```

### Non-interactive

You can also pass command line arguments to set up a new project
non-interactively. See `create-devx --help`:

```bash
Usage: create-devx <project-directory> [options]
```
